<<<<<<< HEAD
Wishlist for a mail client. Because all of the others can't seem to get it right. Might include a proof-of-concept at somepoint in the future.

## Disclaimer/Foreword:

This is a list of things I think could/would/should be in a mail client. In a perfect world, all of the things I list in here would make it into a release of the client. 

I'd like to think of this mostly as a evolving list. At somepoint, it'll be made into a roadmap that is more concrete. For the time being, it's just a loose feature list.
